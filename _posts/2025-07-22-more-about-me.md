My name is Jean Hayes and I am a seasoned technology leader and data architect based in St. Paul, Minnesota.

At Microsoft, I specialize in helping customers leverage the power of Azure AI and Analytics to drive business transformation. My expertise spans across data engineering, data warehousing, advanced analytics, and AI with a particular emphasis on Microsoft Fabric and its capabilities in the Azure ecosystem.

Before joining Microsoft in 2019, I worked both independently and with other companies—supporting clients across industries as they modernized their data platforms and adopted cloud technologies. That hands-on experience in business intelligence and data strategy helped shape my approach to scalable, customer-focused solutions.

I hold multiple Microsoft certifications, including Fabric Analytics Engineer Associate and Azure AI Engineer Associate. My technical toolkit includes Azure Synapse, Data Factory, SQL, Spark, Python, and a wide array of AI services such as Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Foundry services such as Document Intelligence and Azure AI Content Understanding, AI Agents, and Semantic Kernel.

Outside of work, I enjoy skiing, hiking, snorkeling in the USVI, playing pickleball, doing puzzles, hanging with my dog, husband, friends and family, and recently, rediscovering my love of vinyl. One quote that resonates with me is: “The more you know, the more you know you don’t know.” It reflects my lifelong curiosity and commitment to learning, whether it’s mastering skate skiing, getting my butt kicked in pickleball or exploring the latest in AI and cloud technologies.
