The course name and description is above the  course section information. There may be multiple sections for a course so populate the course name and description in each row. To help you link the course name and description to the course section, the first 4 digits of the course is the same for each course name and description.  Each course section always has a location, date, time, number of sessions and price. The course may also have a section name, which would be immediately above the course section number. Usually it is 1 or 2 initials followed by a last name, but sometimes it is a few words. It may be below the course section number or beneath the course description. In that case, use that instructor name for all descriptions. Ignore any other general information community education and table "
