My name is Jean Hayes and I am a Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft. I specialize in helping customers leverage the power of Azure AI and Analytics to drive business transformation. My expertise spans across data engineering, data warehousing, advanced analytics, and AI with a particular emphasis on Microsoft Fabric, Azure AI Foundry and their capabilities in the Azure ecosystem. My goal is to share ideas, patterns, and features that you can actually use and implement in your own environment — things that come up in real-world conversations with customers. I won’t just repeat what’s already in Microsoft Docs or what you can learn from ChatGPT or CoPilot. As David Byrne would say, "Say something once, why say it again?"
